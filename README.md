PROCEDURE:

i. Forward Bias condition
1. Connect the circuit as per the given circuit diagram shown in figure:1
2. Vary the power supply voltage in such a way that the voltmeter reading is 0.1V.
Note the corresponding current reading in Ammeter.
3. Repeat step-2 by increasing the voltage in steps of 0.1V, till 1.0V.
4. Plot a graph taking voltage (V) on X axis and current (I) on Y axis.
   
ii. Reverse bias condition
1. Connect the circuit as per the circuit diagram shown in figure:2
2. Vary the power supply voltage in such a way that the volt meter reading is 1V.
Note the corresponding current reading in Ammeter.
3. Repeat step-2 by increasing the voltage in steps of 1V, till 20V.
4. Plot a graph taking the voltage (V) on X-axis and current (I) on Y-axis

Result:
The V-I characteristic of PN junction diode indicates that the forward current is negligible up to
the knee voltage. After that it increases appreciably. The knee voltage for diode is 0.7 volt. In
reverse bias, the constant current of μA order flows through the diode and it increases gradually to
maximum at large reverse voltage.
